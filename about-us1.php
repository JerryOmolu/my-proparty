      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">MY PROPARTY (Item Information Management System) is an innovative item information management system solution that runs on web and mobile (app) technology. MY PROPARTY is unique, simple, easy to use, and faster to process the registration, storage, and retrieval of item information. </p><br>

<p style="text-align: justify;">MY PROPARTY is built with many dynamic web pages and mobile features, having different access levels and information control for security reasons. Either public or private items or property information can be managed in this system, while assurance of information security (infosec) is of the highest consideration. The technology used for MY PROPARTY has tools designed and deployed to protect sensitive company, individual, or government property information from modification, disruption, destruction, and copying.</p><br> 

<p style="text-align: justify;">The concept of MY PROPARTY is to ensure the proper management of information of mobile phones, tablets, laptops, vehicles, and other items belonging to individuals, companies, and the government. This is so because, by all odds, we have been faced with the problem of individuals or even companies buying stolen items unknowingly without having a system to verify the authenticity of such items. Prominent among the items are mobile phones, laptops, and vehicles (it happens almost every minute of the day). </p><br>

<p style="text-align: justify;">MY PROPARTY creates a platform for individuals and companies to verify the authenticity of any mobile phones, vehicles, and other items before buying, so as not to fall victim to circumstances of buying a stolen item. The verification of items comes from the pre-registration of such items, which forms the most important part of the system. </p><br>

<p style="text-align: justify;">SIGN UP now for free and get your mobile phones/tablets, vehicles, and just any other item registered on MY PROPARTY today to secure their information.</p><br>
