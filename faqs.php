  <h3 style="color:green"><b><i class="fa fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> What is My Proparty?</b></h3>

<h3 style="color:green"><b><i class="fa fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> How does it work?</b></h3>        
  <h5> If you wish to register your items on the dashboard of My Proparty, it's easy to sign up and create an individual account. Provide the relevant information and the ID of each item - such as IMEI for phones, chassis number for vehicles or serial numbers of anything else. Once that is complete, verification can be done from the home page. To verify item(s) Click <a href="https://myproparty.com.ng/verify" style="color:blue">Verify Item</a>. </h5>

<br>
<h3 style="color:green"><b><i class="fa fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> How Long does it take to register an Item?</b></h3>        
  <h5> Processing time for registering any item is generally 3 minutes for an economical fee. Your operational skills and internet speed may reduce this duration.</h5>
<br>
<h3 style="color:green"><b><i class="fa fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> How do i confirm my item registration?</b></h3>        
  <h5> Once the Menu Bar has been clicked on, select 'Verify Item', select an Item to be verified. After this, enter the Unique Number (such as IMEI for Mobile Phones, Chassis Number for Vehicles and so on) in the field provided upon registration.

  <h3 style="color:green"><b><i class="fa fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> Can i register an item on behalf of a third party?</b></h3>        
  <h5> Provide a My Proparty Operator with the person's information and a photocopy of their ID, along with the item you'd like to register. Registration on behalf of another cannot be done independently - it must be done through an Operator as each registration will be tied to the individual who is responsible for it.</h5>

  <h5> Bring a copy of a Sworn Court affidavit and the receipt for the item to your nearest My Proparty Operator. The documents will be checked and ratified by an Admin, who will then arrange for ownership to be transferred. An Admin must carry out the change of ownership, but it should be requested through an Operator.</h5>
<br>
<h3 style="color:green"><b><i class="fa fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> How do i report a stolen Item?</b></h3>

<br>
<h3 style="color:green"><b><i class="fa fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> Can i report an Item that is not registered on My Proparty?</b></h3>        
  <h5> You will need to provide both a police report and the item's unique identifier - such as an IMEI for mobile phones and a chassis number for vehicles - in order to receive any assistance. Unfortunately, without this information, recovery of the stolen item is highly unlikely. </h5>
